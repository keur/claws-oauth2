		    CLAWS MAIL  RELEASE NOTES
                    http://www.claws-mail.org

Claws Mail is a GTK+ based, user-friendly, lightweight, and fast 
email client.

New in this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Message List: A context menu has been added to the column headers,
  it has two entries: a new option, 'Lock column headers', and 'Set
  displayed colums'.

* Folder List:  A context menu has been added to the column headers,
  containing 'Set displayed columns'.

* Preferences: The Display/Summaries option page has been split into
  three notebook pages: Folder List, Message List, and Defaults.
  The Message List page contains the new 'Lock column headers'
  option. The Defaults page contains several new options for new
  folders.

* New Folder Properties: It is now possible to control signing and
  encrypting options on the Compose page. By default it follows the
  Account preferences, but they can be overridden to always sign
  and/or encrypt, or never sign/encrypt.

* Saving sent messages: The global preference, 'Save sent messages',
  can now be overriden by the Folder Property and Account
  preferences. The global preference no longer needs to be activated
  for the Account Preference, 'Put sent messages in ...' option to
  function. Likewise, the Folder Property, 'Save copy of outgoing
  messages to this folder instead of Sent', no longer relies on the
  global preference being set.

* SSL/TLS certificates: The SHA-256 fingerprint is now displayed, and
  the MD5 fingerprint has been removed.

* SSL/TLS certificates list: Status and Expiry columns have been
  added, and expired and invalid certificates are now clearly
  indicated.

* QuickSearch: body searches are now quicker.

* QuickSearch: symbols used in Extended searches are now expanded
  in the 'Edit' dialogue.

* Re-editing: Flags and tags are now preserved when re-editing a
  message.

* Fancy plugin: The minimum required webkitgtk version is now 1.10.0.

* PDF Viewer plugin: Ctrl+scroll now zooms.

* Tools: added cm-break.pl script, which breaks thread references for
  the selected messages; textviewer.pl has been updated and now
  requires perl 5.14.1.

* The legacy "sylpheed-claws" symlink is no longer installed in the
  bindir.

* New translation: Portuguese.

* Updated translations: Brazilian Portuguese, Catalan, Czech, Danish,
  Dutch, French, German, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish.
