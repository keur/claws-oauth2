		    CLAWS MAIL  RELEASE NOTES
                    http://www.claws-mail.org

Claws Mail is a GTK+ based, user-friendly, lightweight, and fast 
email client.

New in this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Add support for TLS Server Name Indication (SNI). This enables the
  sending of your hostname, if available, to the server so that it
  can select the appropriate certificate for your domain. This is
  useful for servers which host multiple domains on the same IP
  address.
  This is a hidden Account preference, 'use_tls_sni', and is enabled
  by default.

* SSL/TLS certificate manager: The Delete key will now delete the
  selected certificate.

* Window sizes are now remembered for the 'Apply tags' and SSL/TLS
  certificate manager windows.

* bug fixes:
	o bug 3519, 'Links including umlauts are broken'
	o bug 4134, ''Save message to' option not set when it should
		     be'
	o prevent the Tools/SSL/TLS Certificates dialogue from
	  crashing when certificate filenames contain a fingerprint.
	o build on GNU Hurd.
	o various build fixes when building without GnuTLS.
