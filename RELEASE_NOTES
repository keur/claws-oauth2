		    CLAWS MAIL  RELEASE NOTES
                    http://www.claws-mail.org

Claws Mail is a GTK+ based, user-friendly, lightweight, and fast 
email client.

New in this release:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* SSLv3 server connections are now disabled by default, in response
  to the POODLE vulnerability, see
  https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-3566.

* Several PGP/Core plugin improvements
  Indicate when a key has been revoked or has expired when displaying
  signature status. For example,
	"Good signature from %s, but the key has expired."
	"Good signature from %s, but the key has been revoked."
  When displaying the full information, show the Validity, and the
  Owner Trust level. Also indicate expired and revoked keys, and
  revoked UIDs.

  The "Content-Disposition: attachment" flag in PGP/MIME signed
  messages has been removed. It was confusing for cetain MUAs.

* A new version of the RSSyl plugin, completely redesigned and
  rewritten. Migration from the previous version is automatic,
  it has a new storage format in ~/.claws-mail/RSSyl/ (hierarchical
  directories instead of flat file format). It uses the expat
  library instead of libxml2 for parsing feed data.

* The results of TAB address completion in the Compose window have
  improved ordering.
	Order of results:
	1. Match beginning of name
	2. Match beginning of additional names
	3. Match complete email address before @
	4. Match beginning of email address
	5. Compare relative position of match
	6. Compare name alphabetically
	7. Compare address alphabetically.
	
* Due to popular demand, use of the Up key in the message body in the
  Compose window stops at the top of the message body and does not
  continue up to the header fields. This reverts the behaviour
  introduced in version 3.10.0.

* In the Compose window, when navigating with the arrow keys,
  selecting, and thus modifying, the Account selector is now
  prevented.

* In the Compose window, a mnemonic (s) has been added to the Subject
  line.

* The Queue folder is highlighted if there are messages in its sub-
  folders and the tree is collapsed.

* When sorting messages by 'thread date', clicking the 'Date' column
  header will now toggle between ascending/descending and will not
  switch to 'date' sorting.

* A new QuickSearch filter has been added that searches a header's
  content only.
  H S : messages which contain S in the value of any header.

* A Reply-To field has been added to the main Template configuration.

* The menubar can now be hidden, default hotkey: F12.

* Fancy plugin: A user-controlled stylesheet can now be used.

* Python plugin: Add flag attributes to MessageInfo object.

* Python plugin: Make 'account' property of ComposeWindow read/write.

* Libravatar plugin: a network timeout option has been added.

* appdata has been added for package managers, it must be
  specifically enabled, using ./configure --enable-appdata
  See http://people.freedesktop.org/~hughsient/appdata/ for further
  information.

* The tbird2claws.py script, for converting a Thunderbird mailbox to
  a Claws Mail mailbox, now handles sub-directory recursion.

* Updated translations: Brazilian Portuguese, Bulgarian, Dutch,
  Esperanto, Finnish, German, Hebrew, Lithuanian, Slovak, Spanish,
  and Swedish
